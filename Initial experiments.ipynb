    "# Frequent Subtree Counting in Random Forests\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to compress the generated source code of decision tree classifiers on embedded devices.\n",
    "Therefore, as a first step, we investigate for several trained random forests, whether they have certain frequent subtrees in common.\n",
    "Such subtrees might be implemented by a function which is called several times in the corresponding places of the decision trees. \n",
    "This can decrease the code size of the generated embedded-c source files and executables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Datasets\n",
    "There are several datasets.\n",
    "At the moment, however, I'll experiment only with 'adult' and 'wine-quality'.\n",
    "The data are given as json files of the following names:"
